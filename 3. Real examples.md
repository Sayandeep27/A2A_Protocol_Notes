# 🌍 Three Companies. Three Agent Frameworks.

### A short story about **CrewAI**, **LangGraph**, and **ADK** talking via **A2A**

---

## 🏢 Company 1: **InsightForge** – Research Agent (CrewAI)

InsightForge was obsessed with **knowledge**.

They didn’t want one generic AI. They wanted a **specialist researcher**.

So they used **CrewAI** to build their flagship agent: **Scout**.

Scout’s responsibilities were crystal clear:

* Deep research
* Reading documents and reports
* Producing structured summaries with insights

Scout worked like a focused employee.

> “Give me a topic,” Scout said,
> “I’ll give you understanding.”

Scout communicated through **A2A**, returning clean, well-organized research outputs.

## 🏢 Company 2: **SearchFlow** – Web Search & Reasoning Agent (LangGraph)

SearchFlow lived on the open internet.

Their challenges involved:

* Web search
* Tool usage
* Decision-making loops

They chose **LangGraph** and built **Navigator**, a stateful web-search agent.

Navigator could:

* Search the web
* Evaluate results
* Retry, refine, or branch based on quality

> “If the answer isn’t good enough,” Navigator said,
> “I’ll try again — smarter.”

Navigator used **A2A** to request deep analysis from Scout and combine it with live data.

## 🏢 Company 3: **OrchestrateX** – Orchestrator Agent (ADK)

OrchestrateX never touched raw data.

They focused on **coordination and control**.

Using **ADK**, they built an orchestrator agent called **Conductor**.

Conductor’s job:

* Decide which agent to call
* Enforce agent contracts
* Assemble final responses safely

> “I don’t execute tasks,” Conductor said calmly.
> “I decide who should.”

ADK allowed Conductor to define strict schemas, making every **A2A interaction predictable and safe**.

## 🔁 A2A in Action (How They Talk)

A user request arrived:

> *“Give me a market analysis with current trends.”*

### Step 1: Orchestration

Conductor (ADK) analyzed the request.

* Web trends needed → Navigator (LangGraph)
* Deep analysis needed → Scout (CrewAI)

### Step 2: Agent-to-Agent Communication

* **Conductor → Navigator (A2A)**
  *“Search the latest market trends.”*

* **Navigator → Scout (A2A)**
  *“Research and summarize key insights.”*

### Step 3: Collaboration

Scout returned structured research.

Navigator enriched it with real-time web context.

### Step 4: Final Assembly

Conductor validated everything against ADK contracts and delivered the final response.

## ✨ Why This Works

| Framework     | Role                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **CrewAI**    | Research agent               |
| **LangGraph** | Web search & reasoning agent |
| **ADK**       | Orchestrator agent           |

**A2A** enables agents to:

* Stay independent
* Collaborate across companies
* Scale without tight coupling

## 🚀 Takeaway

Different frameworks. Different strengths.

One seamless conversation.

That’s the power of **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** systems.
