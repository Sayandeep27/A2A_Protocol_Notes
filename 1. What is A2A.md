# A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Architecture — Complete Beginner to Advanced Guide

---

# 📌 What is A2A?

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** is an architecture where multiple AI agents communicate with each other to complete complex tasks.

```
* Before A2A, agents were framework based.
* Means, LangGraph agents can talk to each other only, not with CrewAI or ADK agents
* Same for CrewAI,Phidata or adk
* Means, Multiagent systems were monolithic and tightly coupled

```

Instead of:

User → Single LLM → Response

We have:

User → Agent → Other Agents → Tools/LLMs → Final Response

So A2A means:

> Agents collaborating with other agents to solve problems.

---

# 🧠 Why Do We Need A2A?

Large problems are difficult for one agent to handle efficiently.

Example problems:

* Build a full research report
* Plan a business strategy
* Analyze a dataset and create insights
* Build code + test + review

Instead of one agent doing everything:

We divide work among specialized agents.

Like a company:

* Research Team
* Finance Team
* Writing Team
* Review Team

Each agent has a role.

This is A2A.

---

# 🏗️ Core Components of A2A

There are 3 very important concepts:

1. Agent
2. Agent Card
3. Agent Executor

Let’s understand each clearly.

---

# 1️⃣ What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is an AI system that:

* Receives input
* Thinks using LLM
* Decides what to do
* May call tools
* May talk to other agents
* Produces output

An agent = Brain + Role + Tools + Decision ability

---

## 🔹 Example Agent

Suppose user says:

"Create a startup market research report."

We create 3 agents:

* Research Agent
* Analysis Agent
* Report Writing Agent

Each agent handles its responsibility.

---

# 2️⃣ What is an Agent Card?

Think of an **Agent Card** like:

> The Identity Card of an Agent

It describes:

* Agent Name
* Role
* Capabilities
* Input Type
* Output Type
* Tools Available

It does NOT execute anything.

It only describes WHO the agent is.

---

## 🔹 Example Agent Card (Conceptual)

```json
{
  "name": "ResearchAgent",
  "description": "Performs web research and gathers information.",
  "inputs": "Research question",
  "outputs": "Structured research notes",
  "tools": ["web_search", "summarizer"]
}
```

This is just metadata.

It helps other agents understand:

"What can this agent do?"

---

# 3️⃣ What is an Agent Executor?

The **Agent Executor** is:

> The engine that actually runs the agent

It:

* Takes input
* Uses LLM
* Decides actions
* Calls tools
* Sends messages to other agents
* Returns output

So:

Agent Card → Description
Agent Executor → Execution

* It is basically wrapper of agents to be able to communicate with A2A protocol
* When you build agent using LangGraph or CrewAI and want to connect those agents with others, then you must wrap it inside an A2A Agent Executor.
* You don't need to do this in case of agents made using ADK because both ADK and A2A protocol is created by Google itself.

---

# 🔗 How They Are Interlinked

Here is the relationship:

User → Agent Executor → Reads Agent Card → Executes logic → Talks to other Agent Executors

Let’s break this clearly.

---

# 🧩 Step-by-Step Flow in A2A

Imagine this scenario:

User asks:

"Analyze EV market in India and create a business summary."

We design 3 agents:

1. Market Research Agent
2. Data Analyst Agent
3. Business Writer Agent

---

## Step 1 — User Sends Request

User → Main Coordinator Agent

---

## Step 2 — Coordinator Reads Agent Cards

Coordinator sees:

* ResearchAgent can gather data
* AnalystAgent can analyze
* WriterAgent can write summary

---

## Step 3 — A2A Communication Happens

Coordinator Agent → Research Agent
Research Agent → Returns raw data

Coordinator Agent → Analyst Agent
Analyst Agent → Returns insights

Coordinator Agent → Writer Agent
Writer Agent → Returns business summary

---

## Step 4 — Final Response

Coordinator → User

# 🏢 Real World Analogy

Think of A2A like a company:

* CEO (Coordinator Agent)
* Research Team
* Data Team
* Content Team

Each has:

* ID Card (Agent Card)
* Actual Work Execution (Agent Executor)

---

# 🧠 Deep Understanding: Who Talks to Whom?

Important concept:

Agent Cards do NOT talk.
Agent Executors talk.

Agent Executors use:

* Their own LLM
* Their tools
* Other Agent Executors

Communication happens between executors.

---

# 🔁 A2A Communication Pattern

There are 3 main patterns:

1. Coordinator Pattern
2. Peer-to-Peer Pattern
3. Hierarchical Pattern

---

## 1️⃣ Coordinator Pattern (Most Common)

One main agent controls everything.

Other agents do specialized tasks.

---

## 2️⃣ Peer-to-Peer Pattern

Agents directly talk to each other.

Example:

Research Agent → Directly sends output to Analyst Agent.

No central controller.

---

## 3️⃣ Hierarchical Pattern

Multiple layers of agents.

Top Agent → Middle Managers → Worker Agents

---

# 🛠️ Where A2A Is Used

* Multi-agent systems
* LangGraph
* AutoGen frameworks
* AI workflow orchestration
* Enterprise AI systems

# 🧾 Complete Concept Summary Table

| Component      | What It Is          | Does It Execute? | Purpose                |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Agent          | AI system with role | Yes              | Performs tasks         |
| Agent Card     | Agent metadata      | No               | Describes capabilities |
| Agent Executor | Execution engine    | Yes              | Runs the agent logic   |

# ⚙️ Simple Pseudo-Code Example

```python
# Agent Card
research_card = {
    "name": "ResearchAgent",
    "role": "Collects EV market data"
}

# Agent Executor
class AgentExecutor:
    def __init__(self, card, llm):
        self.card = card
        self.llm = llm

    def run(self, input_text):
        prompt = f"You are {self.card['role']}. Task: {input_text}"
        return self.llm(prompt)

# Execution
research_executor = AgentExecutor(research_card, llm)
output = research_executor.run("Research EV market in India")
```

---

# 🔍 Key Differences Clearly Explained

Agent = Worker
Agent Card = Resume
Agent Executor = Actual Working Brain

---

# 🎯 When Should You Use A2A?

Use A2A when:

* Problem is complex
* Multiple skills are needed
* You want modular architecture
* You want scalable AI systems

Do NOT use A2A when:

* Simple Q&A system
* Single task application

---

# 🚀 Final Understanding

A2A is about:

* Collaboration
* Modularity
* Specialization
* Scalability

Agent Cards define WHO.
Agent Executors perform HOW.
Agents communicate to complete WHAT.

That is the complete A2A system.
